[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems) has many mathematical challenges, which can be solved through computer programs. The .NET's Math class doesn't provides all mathematical functions needed for the solution of those problems. The main goal of this project is to create a fast and robust library that provides all common mathematical functions that are necessary to those problems's solutions.

I commited the solution for the problems 001, 002, 003, 198 and 230 so far

In addition to my C# solutions there are other projects with the same goals:
